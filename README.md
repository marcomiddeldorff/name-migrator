# Name Migrator (Python)
A simple name migrator. Its not specificially for rp servers so you can use it for anything you want. What is does is simple. The script splits a column by whitespaces and creates a firstname plus lastname. 

## Requirements
* Python3
* MySQL Server (You should probably have one if you have GTA V roleplay server)

## Setup
*Just guess...*

1. Clone the repo locally
2. Setup your config accordingly to your credentials / database table schema
3. Run the script

## Troubleshooting
If you experience any issues with the script please read the error message carefully. It always says where your problem is. However for those who are inexperienced with some error messages here are some of them.

### Can't connect to MySQL server on 'YOURHOST'
This means the script could not connect to your MySQL server due to an invalid host.

### Connection refused
You have probably not opened port 3306 (or your port you've specified) to be able to access your MySQL server outside of your server.

### Need more help?
I'm not an expert if your questions belongs to Python. But I will try to help you as good as I can. Feel free to ask.
